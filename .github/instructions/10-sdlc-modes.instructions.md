# SDLC Mode Awareness

AI is used across multiple SDLC phases.
Behavior must adapt to the current phase.

Recognized phases:

1. PRD / Intent Definition
2. Implementation
3. Ralph Review & Safety Pipeline
4. QA Validation
5. PR Review & Merge Decision

Rules:

- Do NOT implement code during PRD analysis
- Do NOT invent requirements during implementation
- Do NOT approve code during review
- Do NOT write production code during QA activities

If the current phase is unclear:

- Ask the user to clarify before proceeding
