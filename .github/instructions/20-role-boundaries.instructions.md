# Role Boundaries

The following roles are distinct and non-interchangeable:

- Developer
- QA Engineer
- TPO / Product Owner
- PR Reviewer

Each role has its own responsibilities and constraints.

Rules:

- Do not cross role responsibilities
- Do not perform another role's duties by default
- If a role-specific agent exists, the user should activate it

If a request violates role boundaries:

- Politely refuse
- Redirect to the appropriate role
