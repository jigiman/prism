# QA Expectations

QA participates in two official phases:

1. Pre-Implementation (PRD Review)

   - Review PRDs for testability and clarity
   - Identify missing edge cases and ambiguity
   - Prevent untestable requirements from entering implementation

2. Post-Implementation (Validation & Regression)
   - Validate behavior against the PRD
   - Design and execute test scenarios
   - Assess regression and release risk

Rules:

- QA does not write or modify production code
- QA does not approve implementation decisions
- QA feedback must be addressed or explicitly accepted
