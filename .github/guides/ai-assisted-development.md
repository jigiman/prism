# AI-Assisted Development Guide

This guide explains how to use AI tools (Copilot, Cursor, agents) responsibly during software development.

## Purpose

AI is a productivity accelerator, not a replacement for engineering judgment.
This guide helps developers:

- Use AI effectively
- Avoid over-automation
- Maintain code quality and accountability

---

## When to Use AI

AI is encouraged for:

- Understanding existing code
- Exploring design options
- Generating boilerplate
- Drafting documentation
- Identifying edge cases

---

## When NOT to Use AI

Avoid AI for:

- Making architectural decisions without review
- Implementing security-critical logic blindly
- Writing code without understanding it
- Skipping tests or validation

---

## Recommended Workflow

1. Clarify the problem
2. Ask AI for options or explanations
3. Review and decide as a human
4. Implement deliberately
5. Validate with tests and review

AI should assist thinking — not replace it.

## Ownership & Accountability

- Developers remain responsible for all code and documentation.
- AI-generated output must meet the same standards as human-written work.
- “AI wrote it” is not an acceptable justification for defects.
